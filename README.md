CleanSweep is a smartphone-controlled robot designed for floor cleaning. It features rotating mops and a foam roller at the front for effective cleaning. A water pump and reservoir can be activated to moisten the floor for thorough cleaning. The foam roller is adjustable and can be lifted when not in use.

The robot uses an HC-05 Bluetooth module for communication and an Arduino UNO microcontroller to process commands. It is powered by a 12V lead-acid battery, which is suitable for all the motors used in the system.
