		CleanSweep is a smartphone controlled robot that cleans your house's floor! The rotating mops on the front of the robot along with a foam roller at the front can do the job perfectly. There's also a water pump and water reservoir which can be switched on when required to throw water on the floor and make the mops moist for a proper clean. The foam roller is movable, which means you can lift it when not in use.
		The project uses bluetooth communication via an HC-05 bluetooth module to send the commands to the most commonly used microcontroller- Arduino UNO. The robot is powered on a 12V lead acid battery, the ideal voltage for all motors used here.
